# CEF_01
CefGlue in Unity Test (chromium embedded framework)

__DISCLAIMER:__ This is not a production solution. Due to some limitations with Chromium, CefGlue is not Unity Editor friendly out of the box. This project is just a simple example of how to use the CefGlue bindings in Unity, and to potentially provide some direction on how it could be used with other C# game/rendering frameworks.
